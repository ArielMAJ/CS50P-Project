This is my CS50P project!

- Press "Add" to navigate through your folders and select as many images as you wish.
- You can remove individual images from the list by pressing "Remove" after selecting individual ones.
- "Clear" removes all images from the list.
- "Apply" will start removing the background of every image in the list.
- You can scroll down the list of selected images, if it so happens you selected a lot of them.

The app has a loading screen and might stay in it for a few seconds while it loads its dependencies. So, be patient!

Python 3.10.
